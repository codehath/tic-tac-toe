"""
Step 1: Try generating with Cmd+K or Ctrl+K on a new line. Ask for CLI-based game of TicTacToe.

Step 2: Hit Cmd+L or Ctrl+L and ask the chat what the code does. 
   - Then, try running the code

Step 3: Try highlighting all the code with your mouse, then hit Cmd+k or Ctrl+K. 
   - Instruct it to change the game in some way (e.g. add colors, add a start screen, make it 4x4 instead of 3x3)

Step 4: To try out cursor on your own projects, go to the file menu (top left) and open a folder.
